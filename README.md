# Recogito Similarity Scan

This repository contains scripts to experiment with different approaches to 
establish 'similarity' between documents in Recogito. This work is part of
the Mellon-funded work plan for the Pelagios 7 project, specifically the 
work item 'enhancing discovery'.

## Scripts

Proof-of-concept scripts are in Ruby. Run `bundle install` to install 
dependencies before running the scripts. All scripts assume an instance
of Recogito to be running locally.

You may need to modify settings within the script code, according to your 
own environment.
